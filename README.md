# Music Player Web App

This project is a web-based music player where users can upload their favorite songs and listen to them directly in the browser. In addition to basic playback functionality, the app automatically fetches synchronized lyrics to enhance the listening experience, leveraging [syncedlyrics](https://github.com/moehmeni/syncedlyrics) for accurate timing.

## Features

- **Upload Songs:** Users can add their own music files to the playlist.
- **Dynamic Lyrics Display:** Lyrics are automatically fetched and synchronized with the music, providing a karaoke-like experience.
- **Playlist Management:** Organize and play songs with playlist
- **Audio Controls:** Play, pause, skip, and seek functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django and Django REST Framework for API management and handling song data.
- **Database:** SQLite for lightweight, embedded storage of song and user data.
- **Frontend:** JavaScript and AJAX for dynamic song loading and user interactions.
- **Lyrics Syncing:** Integrated with [syncedlyrics](https://github.com/moehmeni/syncedlyrics) for automatic, synchronized lyrics.
